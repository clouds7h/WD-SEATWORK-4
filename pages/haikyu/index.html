                <h4>Hello, this is Kageyama</h4>
                <p>You might know me as the setter for Karasuno. Yeah, I used to be called the "King of the Court"—not exactly a compliment back then. I was all about winning, no matter what, and I didn't care how my teammates felt. But things changed. I learned that volleyball isn't just about me. It's about us. Trusting my teammates, working together, and really understanding each other on the court—that's what made us stronger. It's not just my journey; it's ours.</p>
